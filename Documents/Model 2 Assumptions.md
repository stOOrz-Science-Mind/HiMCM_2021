# Model 2 Assumptions

1. Percipitation will not be taken into account, as the rain is too little to have impact on the water level (see Fig. 1). What's more, the desert climate leads directly to great evaporation of lake water, which is significantly bigger than the percipitation.
2. The change of temperature over years will not be taken into consideration either, for the change over years is too small. The average temperature of a day will be calculated as the mean of maximum and minimum (see Fig. 1).

3. The use of water, which is a part of human factor, will be a constant. However, the constant can change over time as policies and regulations tighten or losen. As shown in Fig. 2, the "sudden"  increase of water level can be interpreted by a change of water using policy [1], and can be shown in the model by a change of the constant.
