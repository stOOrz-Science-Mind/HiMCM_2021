# Defining the Drought

#### using relative difference and ao24

As shown in Fig. Xxxx, a data of the average water level of the past 24 months is caculated and plotted on the same plot as the water level. It is observed that the small peaks and valleys are smoothed while the big ones are postponed. Therefore, we decided to define the drought (in another way) using the ao24 and relative drop, or:
$$
a_x\leq AO24_x \cdot (1+0.5\%).
$$
The $0.5\%$ is determined by the relative drop of commonly accepted droughts.
